Car Sales Analysis

As the years are passing by, more and more cars are being bought. Where do people buy cars from? From car dealerships. Car dealerships need to be updated on which models they should buy based on the buying habits that the citizens of the USA have.
For this project we are going to analyze the US car sales database and find the answers to some interesting questions that a car dealership’s owner would face when trying to decide which cars they should buy. We are going to answer to the following questions: 
•	What does affect a car's price the most?
•	What affects a car's price the most.
•	How much of a brand new car's worth is lost after a year of owning it?
•	Which Manufacturer sells the most cars?
•	What was the model with the highest number of sales?
•	What was the model with the lowest number of sales?
•	What was the most expensive car?
•	What was the least expensive car?
•	Can a predictive model be built in order to predict the price of a car based on some features.
•	Find the most accurate predictive model that predicts the price of a car.

I analyzed the data, built the prediction model and did EDA using the Jupyter Notebook. To provide some higher quality I cleaned the dataframe and replaced the missing values. Next, I made a simple python program that converts the .csv file to an .xlsx file so we can import it in Tableau.
All the Plots from Tableau will be uploaded in the folder “Tableau Plots” and the plots from the EDA will be visible in the Jupyter Notebook file and I will also save them in the folder named “EDA Plots”.
All other necessary information are written as comments in the Jupyter Notebook files.
